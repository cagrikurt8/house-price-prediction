Simple House Price Prediction Model

I created an artificial dataset that contains three row titles: House Price, Square Meter and Year and trained my model with this dataset. This dataset's test part is used to make house price predictions for any given square meter and year values. The model makes a prediction in Turkish Liras for price based on the correlation with square meter and year values.
